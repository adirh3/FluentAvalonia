# FluentAvalonia

Bringing more of Fluent design and WinUI controls into Avalonia.

Currently Targets: Avalonia 0.10.13997-blast & multitargets netstandard2.0;netstandard2.1;net5.0

Note: Windows 7, 8/8.1 are not supported by FluentAvalonia.

Check out the (newly refreshed) sample app for a demo, with code examples, for more!

For the most part, FluentAvalonia has been made independent of Avalonia and does not require you to include a reference to adding the Fluent theme from Avalonia (more on these below)

To include the styles for FluentAvalonia, add the following to your App.xaml (or .axaml)

````Xml
<!-- in App.axaml -->
<!-- Define xmlns:sty="using:FluentAvalonia.Styling" -->

<App.Styles>
    <sty:FluentAvaloniaTheme />
</App.Styles>
````

Namespace for Controls
````Xml
xmlns:ui="using:FluentAvalonia.UI.Controls"
xmlns:uip="using:FluentAvalonia.UI.Controls.Primitives"
````

By default, FluentAvalonia uses the Fluent v2 styles. All controls in core Avalonia also have been provided a template here to provide a cohesive UX, thus making FluentAvalonia independent (style wise). The ONLY exception is `ContextMenu`, where `ContextFlyout` should be used instead.


<details>
    <summary> <b>FluentAvaloniaTheme has several additional options for customizing:</b> </summary>
    
````C#    
// FluentAvalonia Theme is automatically registered with the AvaloniaLocator on startup. To quickly access it in code,
var faTheme = AvaloniaLocator.Current.GetService<FluentAvaloniaTheme>();

// Set the Current theme using the Requested Theme Property

// For Light Mode
RequestedTheme = "Light";

// For Dark Mode
RequestedTheme = "Dark";

// For HighContast
RequestedTheme = "HighContrast";

// On Windows the following properties are available, which all default to true:

// Use the System font as the primary font for the App. On Windows 10, this is Segoe UI. On Windows 11, this is Segoe UI Variable Text
// This value is only respected on startup
public bool UseSystemFontOnWindows { get; set; } = true;

// Use the current User System Accent Color as the Accent Color in the app
public bool UseUserAccentColorOnWindows { get; set; } = true;

// Set the app theme to whatever the Windows theme is, respects HighContrast mode
// This value is only respected on startup
public bool UseSystemThemeOnWindows { get; set; } = true;


// Additionally, by default on Windows, all Win32 windows appear in light mode, regardless of the System setting. To force the window to dark mode:

var thm = AvaloniaLocator.Current.GetService<FluentAvaloniaTheme>();
thm.ForceNativeTitleBarToTheme(Window); // Window is the Window object you want to force

// On a regular window, this will force the titlebar and window border into dark mode. NOTE: If you have accent colors enabled on titlebars and window borders
// in system settings, this most likely won't have much of an effect, since the accent color is used instead.

// If you're using my CoreWindow class, this is done automatically.


// The following properties are available on ALL systems:

// To set a custom accent color set this property. The 3 light and 3 dark variants will be generated for you.
// NOTE: I do not verify whether the custom accent color ensures good legibility and accessibility - that is up to you
// If you would like more control over the shades generated, you can directly override the resources in the Application level ResourceDictionary
public Color? CustomAccentColor { get; set; }

CustomAccentColor = Colors.Orange;

// To return to default, set the property to null;
// On Mac/Linux, and Windows with (UseUserAccentColorOnWindows = false), the default color is SlateBlue. Otherwise it returns to the System defined accent.


// NEW in v1.2, if there are controls you don't use, you can use this property to skip loading their template
// This saves a bit of memory, but more importantly reduces the number of styles that need to be evaluated which can add a performance benefit
// This is a semi-colon (;) delimited string of controls. 
public string SkipControls { get; set; }


// For example, to skip the NavigationView and DataGrid controls
SkipControls = "NavigationView;DataGrid";

// The search mechanism just uses a string.Contains() to evaluate each entry. This for controls like NavigationView and CommandBar where
// those terms are in the related controls (NavigationViewItem, CommandBarButton) - this will automatically remove those as well so you
// don't need to specify everything. See the Styles files in (FluentAvalonia/Styling/[BasicControls | Controls]) for naming - though you
// don't need to include "Styles" unless you want specifically only that file

// Have custom resources you want changed when the Theme changes?

// Listen to the RequestedThemeChanged event:
public TypedEventHandler<FluentAvaloniaTheme, RequestedThemeChangedEventArgs> RequestedThemeChanged;

RequestedThemeChanged += OnAppThemeChanged;

private void OnAppThemeChanged(FluentAvaloniaTheme faTheme, RequestedThemeChangedEventArgs args)
{
    // Retreive the new theme from args
    var newTheme = args.NewTheme;

    // your logic
}
